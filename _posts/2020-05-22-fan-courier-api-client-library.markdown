I want to create a Sylius plugin for FAN Courier that will use their API.
That way the price for transportation is being directly estimated through their API. Also it would be possible to track
AWBs, generate them and much more.

Unfortunately I've not found a great library with tests, CI and quality code.

So `this library` is my attempt to a better library, not necessarily from an architectural standpoint, but from a CI perspective.

You can find on Github all the details necessary for installation.
