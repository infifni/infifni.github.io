I've come across `Sylius` a couple of months ago, and I immediately felt I was home.

Immediately I noticed that even though it's a very competitive platform it lacks local modules (specific to a country), just like `Prestashop` has.

My guess was to start with a payment processor because that is most likely to be used. And EuPlătesc is quite popular in Romania.

So here are the details for this MIT repository:

[Github](https://github.com/infifni/SyliusEuPlatescPlugin)

[Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/infifni/euplatesc-plugin)

You can find on Github all the details necessary for installation.
